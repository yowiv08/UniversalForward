Local modifications: credentials, machine paths, identities, model, prompt, date,
and transport-derived values have been normalized into fixture placeholders.
The browser request builder supplies fresh request identities and appends
browser-specific capability instructions; it does not implement CLI tool execution.

UniversalForward embeds this normalized fixture for connection tests. Its C# builder
supplies request identities and a test-only instruction; no CLI tools are executed.
